# Unity 3D metaballs
Unity 3D implementation of marching cubes algorithm for rendering metaballs. Based on [implementation by Dario Zubovic](github.com/dario-zubovic).

Metaball functions are evaluated on GPU. Falloff functions can be chosen in the compute shader with a define statements.

## TODO list:
* Improve GPU memory and compute by using geometry shaders to instantiate triangles
* implement smooth normals
